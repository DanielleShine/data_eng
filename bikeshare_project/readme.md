# Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data


## Code Quality

### Functionality of Code
All code cells can be run without error.

*Tips: Implement safeguards against invalid user inputs that can potentially break the codes. Please refer to the “Solicit and handle raw user input” rubric item for further details.*

### Choice of Data Types and Structures
Appropriate data types (e.g., strings, floats) and data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.

### Use of Loops and Conditional Statements
Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.

### Use of Packages
Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.

### Use of Functions
Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.

### Use of Good Coding Practices
Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable the readability of the code.

*Tips: Please refer to the Python’s documentation PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions. Example of docstring conventions:*
```python
def function(a, b):
    """Do X and return a list."""
